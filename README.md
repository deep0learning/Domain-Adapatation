# Domain Adaptation

- ResNet-50 baselines for [Office31](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jhoffman/domainadapt/)
- Synthetic gradient module training added
- Filtering for synthetic gradients by voting added
- Adversarial filtering added
- PSPNet baseline for CityScapes added
- Pretrined segmentation model loading done (place in segmentation/pretrained)
- Full-scale testing for segmentation
- Added skeleton code for adaptation of segmentation (filtered gradients) 

## TODO

- Logging and plots for Office31
- Finish segmentation + filtered gradients
